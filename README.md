A Heart Failure Prediction System is developed using Gradient Boosting algorithm for predicting the risk 
level of heart failure. The system uses 11 medical parameters such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type,
Resting BP, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Angina, 
Old Peak, and ST Slope for prediction. The heart failure prediction system detects the likelihood 
of patients getting heart failure. It enables significant knowledge. There is always a need of such 
system that will provide the disease prediction information according to parameter values shared 
by user.
